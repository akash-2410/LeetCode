--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Question---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, 
width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Example---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 1:
Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]
Output: 16
Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image above.

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1]]
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,0]]
Output: 4

Initialization: The function initializes two variables: islands to count the number of islands and neighbors to count the number of neighboring land cells for the islands.
Nested Loop: It iterates through each cell of the 2D grid using nested for loops.
Counting Islands and Neighbors: For each cell in the grid, if the cell contains land (value 1), it increments the islands count. 
Additionally, it checks the neighboring cells to the left and above (if they exist) to determine if there's a neighboring land cell. 
If a neighboring cell contains land, it increments the neighbors count.
Perimeter Calculation: The perimeter of each island is calculated as 4 since each cell of an island contributes 4 sides to the perimeter.
However, if a cell has a neighboring land cell, it means two sides are shared, so 2 is subtracted for each shared side (-neighbors * 2).
Returning Result: Finally, it returns the calculated perimeter.

    int islands = 0;
    int neighbors = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; ++i)
      for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; ++j)
        if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
          ++islands;
          if (i - 1 >= 0 && grid[i - 1][j] == 1)
            ++neighbors;
          if (j - 1 >= 0 && grid[i][j - 1] == 1)
            ++neighbors;
        }

    return islands * 4 - neighbors * 2;
  }
}
