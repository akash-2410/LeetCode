---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Question--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are given an integer array deck. There is a deck of cards where every card has a unique integer. The integer on the ith card is deck[i].
You can order the deck in any order you want. Initially, all the cards start face down (unrevealed) in one deck.
You will do the following steps repeatedly until all cards are revealed:
Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.
If there are still cards in the deck then put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of the deck.
If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1. Otherwise, stop.
Return an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order.
Note that the first entry in the answer is considered to be the top of the deck.

Example 1:
Input: deck = [17,13,11,2,3,5,7]
Output: [2,13,3,11,5,17,7]
Explanation: 
We get the deck in the order [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] (this order does not matter), and reorder it.
After reordering, the deck starts as [2,13,3,11,5,17,7], where 2 is the top of the deck.
We reveal 2, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [3,11,5,17,7,13].
We reveal 3, and move 11 to the bottom.  The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11].
We reveal 5, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [7,13,11,17].
We reveal 7, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [11,17,13].
We reveal 11, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [13,17].
We reveal 13, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [17].
We reveal 17.
Since all the cards revealed are in increasing order, the answer is correct.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Intution--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Approach
Sort the given deck array in ascending order.
Create a result array of the same length as the deck.
Implement a recursive function everyOther to simulate the process of revealing cards.
In the everyOther function, iterate through the result array and fill it with cards from the sorted deck, taking every other card and skipping the rest.
Repeat the process until all cards are revealed.

Complexity
Time complexity: O(Nlog⁡N)O(N \log N)O(NlogN) due to sorting, where N is the number of cards in the deck.
Space complexity: O(N)O(N)O(N) for the result array and recursive stack space.

public class Solution {
    public int[] deckRevealedIncreasing(int[] deck) {
        int N = deck.length;
        int[] result = new int[N]; // Create an array to store the result, initially filled with 0s

        Arrays.sort(deck); // Sort the input deck in increasing order

        // Call the recursive helper function to populate the result array
        // Start with indexInDeck = 0, indexInResult = 0, and skip = false
        return everyOther(deck, result, 0, 0, false);
    }

    // Recursive helper function to populate the result array every other element
    private int[] everyOther(int[] deck, int[] result, int indexInDeck, int indexInResult, boolean skip) {
        int N = deck.length;

        // If we have processed all elements in the deck, return the result
        if (indexInDeck == N) {
            return result;
        }

        // Iterate through the result array
        while (indexInResult < N) {
            // If the current position in result is empty (contains 0)
            if (result[indexInResult] == 0) {
                // If skip is false, place the next element from deck into this position
                if (!skip) {
                    result[indexInResult] = deck[indexInDeck];
                    indexInDeck++; // Move to the next element in deck
                }
                skip = !skip; // Toggle the skip flag
            }
            indexInResult++; // Move to the next position in result
        }

        // Call the function recursively with updated parameters
        return everyOther(deck, result, indexInDeck, 0, skip);
    }
